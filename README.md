Personal Website Design Document

Design language:
Fun, expressive, welcoming, interactive + easy to use

Aim:
Visually instructive of who I am. Not reliant on words to express story.

Features:
- Hero section
- Project display
- Resume pdf downloader
- My contacts + email me
- Links (linkedin, GitHub, YouTube, medium?)

Cool thing:
- Minigame
- 8 bit avatar character of me
- Handwriting elements for personality?
- SVG animations

Considerations:
- Consistent increments of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16) for grid and spacing values
- snake_case_writing_for_headers to represent python ability
